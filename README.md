Introduction: The San Francisco Bay Area is the fifth most popular tourist destination in the United States (Dodd, 2022). As demand for more informal accommodation rises, more tourists are staying in Airbnb rentals, including in the Bay Area (Amaro et al, 2018). Bay Area Airbnb data provides important insight into the factors that influence travelerâ€™s rental location. Since price is often assumed as variable to demand, one way to analyze accommodation choice is through finding factors that influence price. Baruca and Civre (2012) analyzed hotel decision-making, finding that 31.5% of respondents prioritized location, suggesting safety and proximity to preferred destinations are important factors when choosing accommodation. Thus, I ask: how does Airbnb location influence price? To answer my question, I compare 2022 Airbnb data with location safety indicators including crime and poverty variables, and proximity to desired locations including distance to tourist sites and the coast.
